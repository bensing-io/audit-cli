# NAPE (Not Another Policy Engine)

Are you aware that policy as code is nothing more than a false promise? Shockingly, numerous policy engines have been developed by tech-savvy individuals exclusively for other tech-savvy individuals, leaving the rest of us in the dark. But what if I told you that there is a solution that breaks this elitist cycle? Introducing the Audit CLI - a revolutionary approach to automating governance that is simple, accessible, and easily understood by everyone, regardless of technical expertise.

The notion of APEs, or Another Policy Engines, may make your skin crawl. What if I told you that there is an innovative way to encode procedures and intertwine them with security, risk, and compliance considerations to ensure policy validation? Brace yourself for the Audit CLI - a groundbreaking solution that will change the way you think about policy engines. Say goodbye to complexity and exclusivity and hello to user-friendly, comprehensible governance automation.

## NAPE Community

Over time, I hope for NAPE to grow.  This repository (as part of Bensing IO) is where the core NAPE software resides.  The [NAPE Dev](https://github.com/nape-dev) community-oriented repo to house the documentation, NAPE examples, and a community catalog of procedures.

You'll soon be able to find the NAPE landing page at https://www.nape.dev
